# Data-Science-Projects
This is an actively growing collection of simple data science projects that I'm using to learn, some of which I might add to 
a more polished portfolio.

Many of these projects are based on guided projects on the website [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/), which are basically
loose suggestions for the structure of a project.
